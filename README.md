[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8482ec71-0fb8-4936-9002-17b73e4f3eed/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/elated-turing-362f11/deploys)

This repository contains the front end code for the stack overflow tag predictor machine learning project. 

This is a companion web app to the main [project analysis](https://github.com/QED0711/stack_overflow_nlp).

The code here is a simple React app that hooks up to a [Flask backend](https://github.com/QED0711/stack_overflow_flask_app) where our machine learning model is deployed.
